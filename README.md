# Phase_follow-up

In this work, new iterative algorithms of low complexity to decode the data transmitted on a strong phase noise are requested. Our algorithm is based on Sum & Product Algorithm with phase noise messages modeled as normal or Tikhonov distributions. They are simple and efficient algorithms allowing to follow the phase.
